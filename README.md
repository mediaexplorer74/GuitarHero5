This is my "UWP-Remake" of GuitarHero5 1.2 (xap), fun melogic educational game / project. Work-in-progress / not ready

## Preface
Guitar Hero 5 Mobile was indeed released on Windows Phone, specifically for Windows Phone 7, as the latest port of the game according to WikiHero. It was developed and published by Glu Mobile on October 21, 2010. This version combined the main game's setlist, bonus songs from BlackBerry and webOS versions, and most of the "More Music" edition songs, all at full length.

## My 2 cents
- GuitarHero5 1.2 (xap) decompiled by JetBrains DotPeek decompiler
- XAP -> UWP (4 blocks: com.glu.game, shared, binary, and resgen)
- Min. Win. SDK sett to 10240 
- Small Decompiler's bugfix
- Live Services patching (not ready yet) 

## TODO
- Fix 100500 possible bugs :)
- Add kbd / mouse game input
- Change "Mobile" label to "Universal"? ;)))
